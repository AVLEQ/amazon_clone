## 🏆 Bonus: Internship Dashboard Integration

While working on this Amazon clone, I was also actively involved in an **IIM internship** project. As part of it, I'm developing an **interactive dashboard** (in Streamlit) to showcase project information and analytics.

> Building this dashboard was directly enhanced by the knowledge I gained during SoC — especially layout design, JavaScript logic, and UI responsiveness.

📌 The dashboard has been added to GitHub soon as a separate submission.
Heres the link: https://github.com/AVLEQ/IIM_Intern.git

## 🔮 Coming Up in Week 5

* Learn Three.js to enhance product previews
* Build either:

  * A personal portfolio website with JS interactions
  * A calculator app using custom logic
* Possibly deploy project with GitHub Pages
